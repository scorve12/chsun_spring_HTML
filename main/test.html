                <h1>Cat</h1>
                <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated
                    carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Recent advances in
                    archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East
                    around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral
                    cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin.
                    Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong,
                    flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well
                    developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat
                    communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and
                    grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for
                    human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.</p>

                <h2>Characteristics</h2>
                <h3>Size</h3>
                <p>The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.[48] It averages
                    about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12
                    in) long tails. Males are larger than females.[49] Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg
                    (8.8–11.0 lb).</p>
            </div>
            <div id="section3" class="section">
                <h2>Communication</h2>
                <p>Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing,
                    growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing.[105] Their body language,
                    including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all
                    indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms; a raised
                    tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicate hostility. Tail-raising also
                    indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising
                    their tails less often than subordinate ones.[106] Feral cats are generally silent.[107]: 208 
                    Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is
                    solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.</p>

            <div id="section4" class="section">
                <h2>Whiskers</h2>
                <p>To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their
                    body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of
                    objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also
                    trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage</p>
